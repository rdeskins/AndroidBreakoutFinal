# AndroidBreakoutFinal
An Android app written for my final project in CSCD-372 Android Programming at Eastern Washington University in Spring 2020. Android Studio was used for this project.

## Getting Started
I tested this app on a GenyMotion emulator which can be downloaded [here](https://www.genymotion.com/download/). I believe at least Api 19 is needed to run this. From there, dragging and dropping the apk file into the emulator will install the app.
